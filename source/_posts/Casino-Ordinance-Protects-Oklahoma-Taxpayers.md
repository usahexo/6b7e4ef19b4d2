#  Casino Ordinance Protects Oklahoma Taxpayers

In a time when many states are desperate for additional revenue, the Oklahoma Legislature acted decisively to protect its taxpayers.

A new casino ordinance will restrict the number of casinos in the state and ensure that all taxes and fees associated with the industry are paid.

This is great news for Oklahoma, which already has a strong gaming industry. The new ordinance will help to keep this industry strong while protecting taxpayers from becoming victims of fraud or bad business deals.

Governor Mary Fallin praised the new ordinance, noting that it would create much-needed jobs in the state. She also stressed the importance of ensuring that all taxes and fees associated with the industry are paid.

This is an important step forward for Oklahoma, and I look forward to seeing the positive effects it has on our economy.

#  Oklahoma Casinos Win with New Casino Ordinances

Oklahoma casinos are winning with the recent adoption of new casino ordinances. The arrival of these new rules has helped to create a more favorable environment for casino investments and operations in the state.

The new ordinances were adopted in November 2017 and establish a range of requirements for casino operators in Oklahoma. Among other things, the rules impose a licensing fee on casinos and require them to contribute a percentage of their revenue to the state government.

This is good news for Oklahoma's gaming industry, which is estimated to be worth $2.5 billion per year. The arrival of the new ordinances will help to support this growth and create more jobs in the state.

In addition to the positive impact on the casino industry, the new ordinances are also expected to generate significant revenue for the state government. Casino operators are required to pay a licensing fee of $1 million, and they must also contribute 25% of their gross gaming revenue to the state. This is expected to bring in an additional $50 million per year for Oklahoma's coffers.

This is great news for the state, which is facing major budget challenges due to falling oil prices. The extra revenue generated by the new casino ordinances will help to offset these deficits and improve the overall fiscal health of Oklahoma.

#  Casino Gambling Now Legal in Oklahoma

On October 8, 2018, Oklahoma voters approved State Question 792, which legalized casino gambling in the Sooner State. The new law allows casinos to be built in any county with a population of at least 60,000. It also authorizes the Oklahoma Gaming Commission to issue licenses for up to 25 casinos.

Supporters of the measure argued that it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Critics claimed that it would lead to increased crime and gambling addiction.

So far, there has been little interest in building casinos in Oklahoma. The only applicant so far is Kiowa Casino Development LLC, which has proposed building a casino in Cleveland County.

#  Oklahoma Casinos applaud gambling ordinance

The Oklahoma Casinos Association (OCA) is applauding the gambling ordinance recently passed by the Choctaw Nation. The OCA, which represents 16 casinos in the state, says the move will create jobs and generate revenue.

According to a press release from the association, the Choctaw Nation's new ordinance will allow for "the development of new games, such as table games and electronic gaming machines, as well as an increase in betting limits on certain games."

The OCA also points to a study from Econsult Solutions which claims that the new ordinance could generate more than $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. That money would come from increased taxes and fees paid by casino operators as well as employees of the casinos.

In addition to creating jobs and generating revenue, the OCA says that the new ordinance will also help to protect Oklahoma's existing casino industry. They point to states like Iowa and Illinois, which have seen their casino industries crippled by neighboring states with more liberal gambling laws.

"This is a great day for Oklahoma," said Rod Chapel, president of the OCA. "Our state has long been known for its tight restrictions on gambling, and this new ordinance will help us keep that reputation while also bringing in much-needed revenue."

#  New Gambling Ordinance Benefits Oklahoma Casinos

The new gambling ordinance that was just passed in Oklahoma is seen as a big win by the state’s casino industry. The legislation effectively allows casinos to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This comes as a relief to the industry, which has been lobbying for the change for years.

The previous ordinance only allowed casinos to operate from 9am to 2am. This put the casinos at a disadvantage relative to their competitors in other states, where gambling is available around the clock. The new ordinance should help Oklahoma casinos attract more customers and boost revenue.

Governor Mary Fallin praised the passage of the new ordinance, calling it “a great victory for our state’s economy and jobs.” She added that the change would make Oklahoma “more competitive” and “help create more opportunities for businesses and families.”

Representative Jason Nelson, who sponsored the bill, also celebrated its passage. He said that it would help create jobs and bring in additional revenue for the state.

The casino industry has been a key driver of economic growth in Oklahoma in recent years. In 2017, total gaming revenue topped $1 billion for the first time ever. The new ordinance is expected to further bolster this growth and create even more jobs in the state.
