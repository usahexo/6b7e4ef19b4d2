#  Who decides on the line up?

There are many elements that go into a successful football team. Skill, teamwork and tactics are all essential, but which players make up the starting XI? Who decides on the line up?

Traditionally, the head coach is responsible for picking the starting line up. They will consider a variety of factors including the opposition, the team's strengths and weaknesses, and their own personnel. However, there is often pressure from fans, players and owners to play certain players, regardless of their form or suitability for the match.

In recent years, clubs have begun to rely more on data analytics to inform their team selection. Teams now have teams of analysts who track player performance in every possible way. This information can be used to determine who is most likely to win a particular match, as well as to identify under-performing players who may need to be dropped from the squad.

Overall, there is no one definitive answer as to who decides on the line up. It can vary from club to club and even from match to match. However, the head coach is usually the one responsible for making the final decision
