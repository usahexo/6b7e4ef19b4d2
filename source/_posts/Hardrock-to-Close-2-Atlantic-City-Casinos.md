#  Hardrock to Close 2 Atlantic City Casinos

The Hardrock Atlantic City casino will be closing its doors on January 26th. This comes as a shock to many in the area, as just last year two other casinos in the area closed their doors.

What caused the Hardrock to close?

There are many reasons that the Hardrock might have decided to close its doors. The first reason that has been speculated is because of the competition from other casinos in the area. Another reason could be that the casino was not doing well financially.

What are the effects of the closure?

The closure of the Hardrock will have a ripple effect throughout Atlantic City. For one, it will leave over 1,000 people out of work. It will also leave 2 empty casinos in a city that is already struggling. Finally, it could mean that there will be even more casinos closings in the near future.

#  Hardrock to Double Down on Atlantic City

Atlantic City is a popular tourist destination, and Hardrock plans to capitalize on that fact. The company just announced it will open a second casino there in 2020.

The new property, which will be located on the boardwalk, is slated to cost $300 million to build. It will have 400 hotel rooms and 100,000 square feet of gaming space.

"We are excited about this next chapter for Hard Rock in Atlantic City," said Jim Allen, CEO of Hardrock International. "This move underscores our commitment to the city and signals our belief in its future as a premier gaming and tourism destination."

The new casino is expected to create 1,500 jobs.

#  Hardrock Picks Up Latest AC Casino 

The Hardrock casino in Atlantic City has reportedly become the latest casino to pick up an ownership stake from the American Casino operator, AC Entertainment.

According to a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, AC Entertainment has revealed that it has transferred its 30% ownership stake in the Hardrock casino to Gaming and Leisure Properties Inc. The move is said to be part of a bigger plan by AC Entertainment to divest its non-core assets and focus on its core business operations.

It’s not clear exactly how much money changed hands as part of the transaction but it’s thought that Gaming and Leisure Properties paid around $120 million for the 30% stake.

For AC Entertainment, the move is another step in its efforts to simplify its business. The company unloaded its 50% stake in the Tropicana casino earlier this year for $200 million and it also plans to sell its interest in the Margaritaville Resort Casino which is currently under development.

The decision comes as no surprise given that gaming companies are facing increased pressure from investors to focus on their core operations. This is especially true amid growing competition in the industry from states such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

#  Another Casino Sold in Ailing Atlantic City 

Another casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey has been sold, marking the fourth such sale in two years as the gambling industry in the city struggles.

The Taj Mahal was sold for $1 to Hard Rock International, which plans to reopen it as a casino and music venue. The casino has been closed since October 2016 after its owners, billionaire Carl Icahn and his company, missed a $10 million payment to union workers.

Since 2014, five of Atlantic City's 12 casinos have closed. After the latest round of closures in early 2016, the casino market in Atlantic City is now down to seven gaming halls.

The recent spate of casino sales is a sign that the gambling industry in Atlantic City is struggling. Gambling revenue in the city has dropped from a high of $5.2 billion in 2006 to $2.5 billion last year.

Atlantic City isn't the only gambling hub that is struggling. Casinos in Las Vegas and Macau are also seeing declining revenue amid competition from new casinos and increased regulation.

#  Hardrock Infuses Cash Into Struggling Atlantic City Casino Market

Atlantic City's gambling market has been on a downward spiral for the past few years, but a new venture by Hardrock International aims to reinvigorate the area. The casino operator announced this week that it will invest $250 million into renovating the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.

The move is seen as a positive sign for the city, which has been struggling with competition from surrounding states and dwindling tourism numbers. With its new investment, Hardrock hopes to create 1,000 jobs and attract new gamblers to Atlantic City.

The Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort is one of the oldest and most iconic casinos in Atlantic City. It was originally built by Donald Trump in 1990, but has since fallen into disrepair. The renovation project will be spearheaded by Hardrock's CEO, Jim Allen, who is also the owner of the Cleveland Indians baseball team.

"It's no secret that Atlantic City has had its share of troubles in recent years," said Allen in a statement. "But I believe in this city and its potential, and I'm confident that our investment will help revive the area."

Hardrock isn't the only casino operator investing in Atlantic City. In March, Caesars Entertainment Corporation announced plans to spend $175 million on renovations at two of its properties in the city. And earlier this year, MGM Resorts International announced it would spend $1 billion to build a new casino resort in Atlantic City.

These investments come at a time when Atlantic City is facing increasing competition from other states. Gambling revenues in New Jersey have been declining for years, falling from a high of $5.2 billion in 2006 to just $2.4 billion last year. Meanwhile, gaming revenues in Pennsylvania and Delaware are both on the rise.

Some observers have questioned whether Atlantic City can rebound given these economic realities. But with this latest round of investments, there is hope that things may finally be turning around for the seaside resort town.
