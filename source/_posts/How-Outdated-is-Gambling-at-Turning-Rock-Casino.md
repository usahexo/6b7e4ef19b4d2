#  How Outdated is Gambling at Turning Rock Casino?

Michigan's Gambling at Turning Rock Casino is getting a little long in the tooth. The casino is currently the third-oldest operating in the state, having first opened its doors in 1999.

In that time, it has been passed by both FireKeepers Casino Hotel (opened in 2009) and Soaring Eagle Casino & Resort (opened in 1998). Even more concerning for Turning Rock is the fact that there are six other tribal casinos currently operating in Michigan, five of which are newer than Turning Rock.

It's not all bad news for Turning Rock, as they still see over 2 million visitors per year and boast a gaming floor of over 125,000 square feet. But with increasing competition and an aging property, Turning Rock may need to consider making some updates to stay competitive.

One possible avenue could be updating their gaming floor to appeal to a more modern audience. This could involve adding new and popular games like slots or electronic table games. Additionally, they could look to beef up their non-gaming amenities in an attempt to attract those who aren't interested in gambling.

This could include renovating their hotel or restaurant offerings, or even adding a new entertainment venue. Whatever route they choose, it will be important for Turning Rock to act quickly if they want to stay relevant in Michigan's competitive casino market.

#  Is Turning Rock Casino Still Relevant?

The Turning Stone Casino Resort is a world-renowned resort and casino complex in the heart of New York's "Finger Lakes" region, and is one of the largest and most successful tourist destinations in the State. The 4,200 acre resort features 302 hotel rooms, a 97,000 square foot casino gaming floor, three golf courses (including one designed by Arnold Palmer), five restaurants, extensive banquet facilities, a full-service spa and salon, an 18-hole Miniature Golf course and more.

The Turning Stone Casino Resort was built on the site of a former limestone quarry in 1992 by brothers Gilbert and Anthony J. Bino. The casino was originally owned and operated by the Oneida Indian Nation. In early 2013, the Oneida Nation announced it would be seeking to divest its interest in the casino resort. The tribe announced it had retained Deutsche Bank to seek potential buyers for its stake in the property.

In May of 2013, it was announced that the ownership of the Turning Stone Casino Resort had been transferred from the Oneida Indian Nation to a new company formed specifically for this purchase; Two Plus Two Hospitality Group LLC. This new company is made up of two experienced casino executives: Jim Ryan (former President of Caesars Entertainment) and Tom Gallagher (former CEO of MGM MIRAGE). In announcing this new ownership group, Ryan stated his intention to make the Turning Stone Casino Resort "the East Coast's premier destination resort".

So far, it seems that Ryan and Gallagher are making good on their promise. Since taking over ownership of the property, they have made significant investments in upgrading both the physical plant and the gaming offering at the casino resort. They have also instituted a number of marketing programs aimed at attracting more visitors to the property.

One such program is "Turning Stone Rewards", which is their player loyalty program. It is one of the most rewarding loyalty programs in New York state, with points that can be redeemed for free play, food comps, room nights and more. They have also introduced a new player rewards card called "The Club". This card gives players access to exclusive benefits like complimentary valet parking, express check-in/check-out and complimentary room upgrades (subject to availability). The Club membership is free for all guests who sign up when they visit the casino resort.

In addition to these marketing initiatives, Ryan and Gallagher have made substantial investments in both the physical plant and gaming product at Turning Stone Casino Resort. Some of these investments include:

* $6 million renovation of Players Club cardroom including installation of new poker tables, chairs and carpeting * $1 million renovation of High Limit area including installation of new blackjack tables * $500 thousand upgrade to internet bandwidth capacity to support high-speed gaming * $250 thousand upgrade to audio/visual systems throughout casino floor * Addition of popular slot machines like Game King Slots Triple Double Diamonds * New player kiosks throughout casino floor


  So far it would appear that Turning Rock Casino Resort is still very relevant despite some changes in ownership back in 2013. With an expansive list if offerings from luxurious accomodations ,to award winning golf courses ,three lavish restaurants ,a first class spa ,and an exciting 97000 sqft casino filled with all your favorite games , there's something for everyone here .
