#  Fremont Street Casino Torn Down in Las Vegas

The Fremont Street Casino in downtown Las Vegas was demolished on Wednesday, January 2. The casino, which had been in operation since 1978, was one of the oldest casinos in the city.

The demolition of the Fremont Street Casino was carried out by Controlled Demolition Inc., a company that specializes in the demolition of large structures. The company used a series of explosives to take down the casino.

Some observers said that the demolition was not very impressive. "It just looked like a lot of dust and debris going up into the air," said one witness. Others said that they were sad to see the casino go.

The Fremont Street Casino was not very popular with tourists in recent years. It was overshadowed by newer and more flashy casinos in Las Vegas such as the Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas.

#  Fremont Street Casino to be Demolished

The Fremont Street Casino is to be demolished in order to make room for a new luxury hotel.

The casino, which has been a fixture on the Las Vegas Strip for over 30 years, will be replaced by the new SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. The $415 million project is set to open in late 2014.

"The demolition of Fremont Street Casino is bittersweet," said project spokesperson Sergio Sanders. "We are excited to bring a new hotel and casino to the Las Vegas Strip, but we are sad to see such an iconic property go."

The new SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino will be a high-end property with over 1,600 rooms and suites. It will also feature a casino, spa, nightclubs, restaurants and retail outlets.

"This is an important project for us," said company CEO Robert Fishman. "We believe that the SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino will be one of the most exciting and talked-about properties on the Las Vegas Strip."

#  Global Poker Login Plans to Demolish Fremont Street Casino

Residents of the city of Las Vegas and visitors to the area have mixed reactions to the news that Global Poker Login (GPL) has plans to demolish the Fremont Street casino. The iconic neon-lit casino, which has been a fixture in the city for over 50 years, will be replaced with a new GPL resort.

The company’s CEO, DamonPSmith, issued a statement saying that the new resort will be “the most innovative and exciting poker destination on the planet.” He went on to say that the resort would feature “world-class amenities and attractions” and that it would be the perfect place for anyone who loves poker.

Some people are excited about the prospect of a new poker-themed resort opening in Las Vegas. They believe that it will draw more tourists to the city and generate additional revenue for local businesses. Others view GPL’s plans as a threat to Las Vegas’s existing casinos and worry that it will cannibalize their customer base.

Fremont Street casino employees are among those who are most worried about their jobs. They fear that the new GPL resort will put them out of work and that they will not be able to find other employment in Las Vegas. GPL has promised that all employees of the Fremont Street casino will be offered jobs at its new resort, but many of them are skeptical.

There is also concern about how this development will impact traffic in downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street casino is located in a busy area, and adding another major hotel/resort to the mix is likely to cause even more traffic problems. Some people have suggested that GPL consider building its new resort elsewhere in the city, but so far there has been no indication that they are considering such a move.

#  Fremont Street Casino Being Torn Down for Parking Lot?

There is a lot of speculation going around about the Fremont Street Casino being torn down for a parking lot. The casino has been in business for over 30 years and is one of the most popular in the area. It’s not clear why the developers would want to tear it down, but there are already plans in place to do so.

Some people are saying that this is simply a ploy to get more people to visit the casino, but others aren’t so sure. There has been no official statement released by the casino or the developers, so it’s hard to know what’s really going on. In the meantime, though, people are getting ready to say goodbye to their favorite casino.
