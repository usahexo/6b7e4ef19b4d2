      <h1 id="What-is-the-Hot-7-game"><a href="#What-is-the-Hot-7-game" class="headerlink" title="What is the Hot 7 game?"></a>What is the Hot 7 game?</h1><p>The Hot 7 game is a dice game that is played by rolling two dice. The player must then match the total number on the dice with one of the numbers in the Hot 7 layout. If they are able to do this, they will earn points and can continue playing. If they are not able to match any of the numbers in the layout, their turn ends and they lose all of their points.</p>
<p>The Hot 7 layout features seven different spaces that players can match their total to. These spaces are numbered 1-7 and feature different point values. The player earns the points for the space that they match their total to, regardless of which die produces the number. For example, if a player rolls a 3 and a 5, they would match their total to either 3 or 5 and would earn the points for that space.</p>
<p>The game ends when a player either matches all of the numbers in the Hot 7 layout or runs out of possible matches. The player with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-rules-of-the-Hot-7-game"><a href="#What-are-the-rules-of-the-Hot-7-game" class="headerlink" title="What are the rules of the Hot 7 game?"></a>What are the rules of the Hot 7 game?</h1><p>The Hot 7 game is a game of chance in which each player has seven chances to win. The player starts by placing a bet and then selecting one of the seven numbered balls from a drum. If the number on the ball matches the number that the player selected, then the player wins and is paid according to the payout schedule. If the number on the ball does not match the number that the player selected, then the player loses the bet and the game continues.</p>
<p>When playing Hot 7, it is important to remember that only one bet can be placed at a time. This means that players cannot wager on multiple numbers simultaneously. It is also important to note that players are not allowed to touch or change any of the balls once play has commenced. If a player touches or changes a ball, their bet will automatically be forfeited.</p>
<p>The table below shows some of the commonly accepted Hot 7 payouts:</p>
