      <h1 id="How-do-you-play-European-roulette"><a href="#How-do-you-play-European-roulette" class="headerlink" title="How do you play European roulette?"></a>How do you play European roulette?</h1><p>European Roulette is a casino game where you can bet on a particular number, range of numbers, color, or whether the number will be odd or even.</p>
<p>To play European roulette, first you select how much you want to bet. You can place your chips on the table layout in specific areas designated for each type of bet. After all players have placed their bets, the croupier will spin the wheel in one direction and then launch the white ball in the opposite direction around the outer edge of the wheel. The ball eventually falls into one of 37 slots on the wheel, each corresponding to a number on the betting layout. If your selected number comes up, you win!</p>
<p>There are a few different types of bets that you can make when playing European Roulette:</p>
<p>Straight Bet - A bet on a single number.</p>
<p>Split Bet - A bet on two adjoining numbers either horizontal or vertical.</p>
<p>Street Bet - A bet on three numbers in a row (horizontal).</p>
<p>Corner Bet - A bet on four numbers that form a square (vertical).</p>
<p>Six Line Bet - A bet on two adjacent Street Bets (horizontal).</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play-American-roulette"><a href="#How-do-you-play-American-roulette" class="headerlink" title="How do you play American roulette?"></a>How do you play American roulette?</h1><p>American roulette differs from other Roulette versions in that it has two zeroes on the wheel as opposed to just one. This makes the odds of winning much lower and is the main reason why American Roulette is not as popular as its European counterpart.</p>
<p>There are 38 numbers on an American roulette wheel, numbered 1-36, plus a 0 and a 00. To bet, players must first place their chips on the table where they want them to be placed. After all bets have been placed, the dealer will spin the ball around the outer edge of the roulette wheel. The ball will eventually fall into one of the slots, and whoever has placed a bet on that number will win. If you bet on a number and the ball falls into one of the two zeroes, then you’ll lose your bet.</p>
<p>There are a number of different betting options available in American Roulette. You can bet on individual numbers, or you can bet on groupings of numbers. There are also side bets available which include betting on whether or not the ball will land in a certain pocket, or betting on whether or not the ball will land on black or red.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play-French-roulette"><a href="#How-do-you-play-French-roulette" class="headerlink" title="How do you play French roulette?"></a>How do you play French roulette?</h1><p>The aim of roulette is simply to bet on which number the ball will land on when the wheel stops spinning. French Roulette has a single zero, while American Roulette has both a single and double zero.</p>
<p>To place a bet, you first need to place your chips on the table. Different bets are worth different amounts, so it’s important to familiarize yourself with the betting options before playing. You can usually find a list of all the available bets in the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
<p>Once you’ve placed your chips, choose which number you want to back by clicking on it. If you want to make multiple bets on different numbers, just hold down the left mouse button and drag across the numbers you want to bet on.</p>
<p>When the ball lands in a numbered slot, that number is highlighted and all active bets are paid out accordingly. If your number comes up, you win!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-differences-between-the-three-games"><a href="#What-are-the-differences-between-the-three-games" class="headerlink" title="What are the differences between the three games?"></a>What are the differences between the three games?</h1><p>Games of the Three Kingdoms (GOTK) are a series of turn-based strategy games based on the historical period of China known as the Three Kingdoms period. There are three games in the series, each with different features: “Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI”, “Dynasty Warriors 7” and “Sangokushi 12”.</p>
<p>“Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI” is the latest game in the series, released in 2011. It is a PC game that can be played either solo or co-op. The game features over 190 officers from the Wei, Shu and Wu armies, as well as famous historical figures such as Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Sun Quan. Each officer has their own unique stats and abilities, which players must use strategically in order to win battles.</p>
<p>“Dynasty Warriors 7” is a console game released in 2011 for Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. It is a prequel to “Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI”, taking place during the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Battle of Hu Lao Gate. The game features 48 playable characters, each with their own unique fighting style and story.</p>
<p>“Sangokushi 12” is also a console game, released in 2012 for Playstation 3 and Wii U. It is set shortly after “Dynasty Warriors 7” and tells an original story not based on history. The game features 70 playable characters, including fan favourites such as Lu Bu and Zhao Yun.</p>
