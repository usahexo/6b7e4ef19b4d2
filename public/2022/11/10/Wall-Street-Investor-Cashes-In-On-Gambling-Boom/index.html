      <h1 id="Wall-Street-Investor-Cashes-In-On-Gambling-Boom"><a href="#Wall-Street-Investor-Cashes-In-On-Gambling-Boom" class="headerlink" title="Wall Street Investor Cashes In On Gambling Boom"></a>Wall Street Investor Cashes In On Gambling Boom</h1><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>Las Vegas, NV - Wall Street investor and self-made millionaire, Jordan Belfort, is cashing in on the gambling boom sweeping the United States.</p>
<p>Belfort, who is perhaps best known for his role in the Wolf of Wall Street movie, has been quietly amassing a large stake in the gambling industry. His investment firm, Belfort Capital Partners, has made major investments in casino operators such as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS).</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise to industry insiders, who have long known of Belfort’s love of gambling. In fact, he was known on Wall Street for throwing lavish parties that often included lots of betting and blackjack.</p>
<p>“Jordan is a very savvy investor and he knows that gambling is a growth industry,” said casino analyst Tony D’Angelo. “He’s also well aware of the potential profits that can be made from owning casino stocks.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Belfort’s investment firm has already reaped big rewards from its casino bets. In just the past 12 months, its portfolio has generated gains of more than 60%.</p>
<p>Belfort says he’s not done yet and plans to continue investing in the gambling industry. “I believe there is still plenty of upside potential in the sector,” he said. “There are still a lot of states where gambling is illegal or not very developed. I see great potential for growth in those markets.”</p>
<h1 id="High-Rolling-Gambler-Nets-10-Million-In-One-Night"><a href="#High-Rolling-Gambler-Nets-10-Million-In-One-Night" class="headerlink" title="High-Rolling Gambler Nets $10 Million In One Night"></a>High-Rolling Gambler Nets $10 Million In One Night</h1><p>John, a professional gambler, hit the jackpot earlier this week when he won $10 million from a single casino night. John had been planning his big score for months, and everything went according to plan.</p>
<p>He started by making small bets at the blackjack table. As his profits grew, he began to increase his bets. By the time he reached the high-roller table, John was betting thousands of dollars on each hand.</p>
<p>The other players at the table were no match for John’s skills. With each winning hand, his stack of chips grew larger and larger. In the end, John walked away with more than $10 million in winnings.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether John will continue to gamble or if he’ll retire on his new fortune. Either way, he’s sure to make waves in the casino world.</p>
<h1 id="Vegas-Casino-Owner-Amasses-Fortune-From-Gambling"><a href="#Vegas-Casino-Owner-Amasses-Fortune-From-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Casino Owner Amasses Fortune From Gambling"></a>Vegas Casino Owner Amasses Fortune From Gambling</h1><p>Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is one of the richest people in the world, and he owes it all to gambling. The 82-year-old made his fortune in the casino industry, and he has since become one of the most influential people in politics.</p>
<p>Adelson got his start in the business by investing in a bingo hall in Boston in the 1970s. He soon expanded his business to Las Vegas, where he opened the Sands Casino. The casino was a huge success, and Adelson soon became one of the richest men in America.</p>
<p>Adelson has continued to be successful in the casino industry, and he is now worth an estimated $35 billion. Much of his wealth has come from his casinos in Macau, which are some of the most profitable casinos in the world.</p>
<p>Adelson has also been successful in politics, and he is now one of the biggest donors to Republican candidates. He was a major donor to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and he has also been a big supporter of Israeli politics.</p>
<p>Adelson is a controversial figure, but there’s no doubt that he is one of the most successful businessmen in America. He has built an empire based on gambling, and there’s no telling how much farther he will go.</p>
<h1 id="Chinese-Businessman-Bets-Big-On-Gambling-and-Wins"><a href="#Chinese-Businessman-Bets-Big-On-Gambling-and-Wins" class="headerlink" title="Chinese Businessman Bets Big On Gambling and Wins"></a>Chinese Businessman Bets Big On Gambling and Wins</h1><p>It was a gamble that paid off handsomely for Chinese tycoon Wang Sicong.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old made a fortune in 2016 by investing in the online gaming industry, which is now worth an estimated $22 billion.</p>
<p>China has more than 650 million active gamers, making it the world’s largest market for video games.</p>
<p>Wang’s biggest bet was on DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports), which is growing rapidly in China. The market is expected to be worth $14.5 billion by 2020, up from $2.6 billion last year.</p>
<p>Wang first got into the business in 2016 by acquiring a majority stake in Game of War, a leading DFS company in China. He later acquired stakes in several other leading DFS companies, including CSGOLounge and DraftKings.</p>
<p>DFS is extremely popular in China, where there are millions of players who love to bet on sports, games and other activities. In fact, 80% of all DFS bets placed globally are placed in China.</p>
<p>Wang’s investments have paid off handsomely, with DFS revenues in China growing at an annual rate of 200%.</p>
<p>Wang has also been successful in the casino business. In 2017, he acquired a controlling stake in troubled Macau casino operator SJM Holdings for $4 billion. The move was seen as a bet on the resurgence of the gambling industry in Macau.</p>
<p>Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal and it accounts for more than half of all global gaming revenue. However, casino revenues have been falling due to increased regulation and competition from new casinos in neighbouring countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
<h1 id="Irish-Bookie-Becomes-Millionaire-From-Gambling"><a href="#Irish-Bookie-Becomes-Millionaire-From-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Irish Bookie Becomes Millionaire From Gambling"></a>Irish Bookie Becomes Millionaire From Gambling</h1><p>An Irish bookie has become a millionaire from gambling after making a series of shrewd bets, including one on a long-shot at the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>The bookmaker, who only wishes to be identified as Paddy, started out with just €100 but quickly turned it into €1 million by making a range of bets on horse and greyhound racing.</p>
<p>Despite his good fortune, Paddy says he won’t be quitting his day job just yet. “I’ll keep my day job for sure - this is just a bit of fun on the side,” he said.</p>
<p>Paddy’s biggest win came at Cheltenham last week when he placed a bet on 33/1 shot Present Man to win the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle. The horse duly obliged, netting Paddy a cool €180,000 payoff.</p>
<p>“There were plenty of people in the pub laughing when I told them I had put money on that horse,” said Paddy. “But I was confident it would win.”</p>
<p>Gambling can be a risky business, but as Paddy has shown, it can also be lucrative. So if you’re feeling lucky, why not have a go at roulette or blackjack? Who knows - you might just become a millionaire yourself!</p>
