The regulation is effective immediately and applies to all active and reserve component Soldiers of the United States Army.</p>
<p>The new regulation tightens restrictions on Soldiers gambling with government funds. Gambling with government funds is now prohibited except when it is expressly authorized by law or regulation. This includes wagering (or betting) of any kind, playing cards, dice, or other games for money or anything else of value.</p>
<p>This new regulation does not prohibit Soldiers from participating in legal forms of gambling such as lotteries conducted by state governments or charitable organizations. It also does not prohibit Soldiers from using their own personal funds to gamble.</p>
<p>In addition, the new regulation allows Roth IRAs to be established for Soldiers starting Jan 1, 2020. Eligible Soldiers will have until Dec 31, 2020 to establish a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow contributions to be made after-tax and withdrawals are tax-free qualified distributions if made after age 59 1/2. </p>

<h1 id="Army-Tightens-Rules-on-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs"><a href="#Army-Tightens-Rules-on-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs" class="headerlink" title="Army Tightens Rules on Gambling and Roth IRAs"></a>Army Tightens Rules on Gambling and Roth IRAs</h1><p>The U.S. Army has announced new rules that restrict soldiers from gambling and investing in Roth IRA accounts. The new regulations, which took effect on October 1, 2016, are meant to prevent soldiers from engaging in activities that could lead to ethical breaches or financial misconduct.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, soldiers are prohibited from gambling at all military-sponsored events, including casinos and racetracks. Gambling is also forbidden in all personal residences on or off military installations. Additionally, soldiers are barred from investing in Roth IRAs unless they can demonstrate that they have an annual income of at least $200,000.</p>
<p>Army officials say the new regulations are necessary to protect the interests of soldiers and taxpayers. They note that gambling can lead to financial problems and ethical violations, such as cheating or stealing. Furthermore, they argue that Roth IRAs are inappropriate for most soldiers because they offer very few tax benefits compared to other investment options.</p>
<p>Some soldiers and veterans groups have criticized the new rules, saying they place unnecessary restrictions on service members’ personal finances. Others argue that the Army should do more to enforce existing regulations governing gambling and financial misconduct.</p>
<h1 id="New-Army-Regulations-Address-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs"><a href="#New-Army-Regulations-Address-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs" class="headerlink" title="New Army Regulations Address Gambling and Roth IRAs"></a>New Army Regulations Address Gambling and Roth IRAs</h1><p>On Jan. 1, the U.S. Army released a new regulation addressing two seldom-discussed topics: gambling and Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The new regulation, Army Regulation 27-1, merges existing policies on the two subjects into a single document.</p>
<p>The regulation prohibits soldiers from participating in most forms of gambling, while setting rules for how Roth IRAs can be used to save for retirement. The new regulation replaces older policies on gambling and Roth IRAs, which were last updated in 2004 and 2006, respectively.</p>
<p>The prohibition against gambling is largely unchanged from previous policies. Soldiers are not allowed to gamble in any form, whether it is through traditional casinos or online poker sites. The only exception is for lotteries run by state governments, which are legal under federal law.</p>
<p>The new Roth IRA rules are more generous than the old rules. Under the old rules, soldiers could only use Roth IRAs to save for retirement if they earned less than $95,000 per year. The new rules raise the income limit to $120,000 per year.</p>
<p>Soldiers who exceed the income limit are still allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA, but their contributions will be subject to a tax penalty. In addition, the army will now allow soldiers to withdraw money from their Roth IRAs without penalty for certain hardships, such as medical expenses or tuition payments.</p>
<p>The new regulation is designed to make it easier for soldiers to save for retirement. The Roth IRA rules in particular should help soldiers who exceed the income limit save for their future without paying a penalty.</p>
<h1 id="Does-the-Army-Have-a-Stance-on-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds"><a href="#Does-the-Army-Have-a-Stance-on-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds" class="headerlink" title="Does the Army Have a Stance on Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?"></a>Does the Army Have a Stance on Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?</h1><p>The Army has a stance on gambling with Roth IRA funds. Soldiers are not allowed to gamble with their retirement money. This is specified in Army Regulation 670-1, which states “A Soldier may not use military or other Government funds to gamble.”</p>
<p>Since Roth IRA funds are considered “other Government funds,” they are off-limits for gambling purposes. This rule applies whether the gambler is using his or her own Roth IRA money or money from another source, such as a spouse’s account.</p>
<p>Gambling with retirement money can be costly in more ways than one. Not only can you lose your hard-earned savings, but you may also face disciplinary action from the Army. So it’s best to avoid any temptation to gamble with your Roth IRA funds, and stick to responsible investing instead.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-the-Army-Regulation-Say-About-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds"><a href="#What-Does-the-Army-Regulation-Say-About-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Army Regulation Say About Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?"></a>What Does the Army Regulation Say About Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?</h1><p>Gambling with Roth IRA funds is allowed by the Army Regulation, as long as it does not jeopardize the fund’s tax-exempt status. Gambling in a personal capacity is legal, but gambling with Roth IRA money may be subject to penalty if it is deemed to be an unrelated business activity.</p>
<p>The IRS has specific rules about how much of your Roth IRA can be used for gambling without affecting its tax-exempt status. Up to $10,000 per year can be used for gambling without risking the tax exemption on your Roth IRA. Any money that is withdrawn from the Roth IRA for gambling purposes will be treated as taxable income.</p>
