        <h1 id="Local-man-becomes-millionaire-overnight-from-casino-winnings"><a href="#Local-man-becomes-millionaire-overnight-from-casino-winnings" class="headerlink" title="Local man becomes millionaire overnight from casino winnings!"></a>Local man becomes millionaire overnight from casino winnings!</h1><p>A local man has become a millionaire overnight, after winning big at a casino.  The man, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that he had only been planning to gamble for a bit of fun, but ended up winning $1.3 million on a single spin of the roulette wheel.</p>
<p>“I still can’t quite believe it’s happened”, the man said in an interview. “I went in there with just a few hundred dollars and walked out with more money than I could have ever imagined.” </p>
<p>The man says that he doesn’t plan to spend his winnings all at once and is currently looking into ways to invest them wisely. In the meantime, he’s enjoying the spoils of his good fortune - treating himself to a new car and some luxury holidays.</p>
<p>While this kind of sudden wealth may seem like a dream come true, it’s important to remember that casinos are designed to take your money, not give it back! So if you’re thinking of hitting the casino floor in search of your own fortune, be sure to go in with your eyes open and set yourself some sensible limits.</p>
<h1 id="Woman-wins-big-time-playing-slots-–-pays-for-new-house-car-and-more"><a href="#Woman-wins-big-time-playing-slots-–-pays-for-new-house-car-and-more" class="headerlink" title="Woman wins big time playing slots – pays for new house, car and more!"></a>Woman wins big time playing slots – pays for new house, car and more!</h1><p>A woman who goes by the name of “Sarah” has reportedly hit the jackpot while playing slots at a casino in Las Vegas. Sarah is said to have won over $1 million, which she plans on using to purchase a new house, car and other belongings.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Sarah has had some good luck at a casino – back in 2014 she also won a large sum while playing slots. In fact, Sarah has now won over $2.5 million in total from playing slots at various casinos around the world.</p>
<p>When asked what her secret to winning big is, Sarah replied: “I just go with what my gut tells me, and I always stick to betting small amounts until I hit the right combination.”</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Sarah is one very lucky lady – not only did she win a large sum of money this time around, but she’s also been able to do so consistently over a period of several years. Here’s hoping that her luck continues!</p>
<h1 id="Couple-lands-massive-jackpot-on-their-first-visit-to-the-casino"><a href="#Couple-lands-massive-jackpot-on-their-first-visit-to-the-casino" class="headerlink" title="Couple lands massive jackpot on their first visit to the casino!"></a>Couple lands massive jackpot on their first visit to the casino!</h1><p>John and Jane were over the moon when they found out they had won a jackpot worth $1.5 million on their very first visit to the casino! They were ecstatic, and John said it was like a dream come true.</p>
<p>“We’ve been planning to go to the casino for months, but we never imagined that we would actually win anything,” Jane said. “We’re so happy that this worked out for us on our first try.”</p>
<p>The couple isn’t exactly sure what they’re going to do with all of that money, but they’re excited to start spending it on some of their long-term goals. They plan to take a trip to Europe and invest in some new property.</p>
<p>“We’re just really blessed, and we can’t thank God enough for this amazing blessing,” Jane said.</p>
<h1 id="Man’s-lucky-streak-at-the-poker-table-nets-him-1-million"><a href="#Man’s-lucky-streak-at-the-poker-table-nets-him-1-million" class="headerlink" title="Man’s lucky streak at the poker table nets him $1 million!"></a>Man’s lucky streak at the poker table nets him $1 million!</h1><p>A 42-year-old man from the United States of America visiting Las Vegas for a bachelor party hit it big over the weekend, playing poker at the Bellagio casino and walking away with more than $1 million after only three days of play.</p>
<p>The man, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he had been on something of a lucky streak at the table, making some good hands and cashing in on some high-value bets. He was playing a mix of Texas hold’em and Omaha poker games with buy-ins ranging from $200 to $1,000.</p>
<p>In total, he walked away with just over $1.2 million in winnings, having started the trip with only around $6,000 in his pocket. Asked what he planned to do with the money, he replied that he and his friends were going to ‘have some fun’ before returning home.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that this man has had some luck at the poker table; in fact, over the past few years he has managed to make around $2 million from playing the game. He attributes his success to a combination of good cards and sound judgement when it comes to reading other players.</p>
<p> Poker is known as a game of luck as well as skill, and it’s not uncommon for amateur players to beat out seasoned professionals on any given day. This is what makes the game so fascinating; even when you think you know what’s going on, Lady Luck can still step in and deliver a knockout punch.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-become-a-high-roller-–-tips-from-a-professional-gambler"><a href="#How-to-become-a-high-roller-–-tips-from-a-professional-gambler" class="headerlink" title="How to become a high roller – tips from a professional gambler"></a>How to become a high roller – tips from a professional gambler</h1><p>Gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be a way to lose money if you’re not careful. If you want to become a high roller, there are a few things you need to know.</p>
<p>In order to become a high roller, you need to first understand what it is. A high roller is someone who gambles frequently and spends large sums of money while doing so. In order to become one, you need to have both the money and the desire to gamble frequently.</p>
<p>If you want to become a high roller, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of success:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Gamble with money that you can afford to lose: This may seem like common sense, but it’s important to remember. Gambling should always be seen as a form of entertainment, and not as an investment. If you start gambling with money that you cannot afford to lose, you are likely to end up in debt.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do your research: Before playing any game, it’s important to understand the rules and how the game works. This is especially true for games like blackjack and poker, which require some skill in order to be successful. You don’t want to lose your hard-earned money on something that you don’t understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamble responsibly: Just like with anything else in life, gambling should be done in moderation. Don’t let gambling take over your life – it should be something that you do for fun, not something that governs your every move.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Join a casino loyalty program: Casinos often offer loyalty programs that give players rewards for playing at their casino. These programs can offer everything from free meals and hotel stays to cash back on your losses. Joining one of these programs can help offset some of the costs associated with gambling.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use proper bankroll management: One of the most important skills for any gambler is proper bankroll management. This means knowing how much money you are willing to lose on any given day and not exceeding that limit no matter what happens at the casino table. By using proper bankroll management techniques, you can ensure that your gambling sessions stay enjoyable – and affordable – no matter what happens at the table.</p>

        <h1 id="Wall-Street-Investor-Cashes-In-On-Gambling-Boom"><a href="#Wall-Street-Investor-Cashes-In-On-Gambling-Boom" class="headerlink" title="Wall Street Investor Cashes In On Gambling Boom"></a>Wall Street Investor Cashes In On Gambling Boom</h1><h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>Las Vegas, NV - Wall Street investor and self-made millionaire, Jordan Belfort, is cashing in on the gambling boom sweeping the United States.</p>
<p>Belfort, who is perhaps best known for his role in the Wolf of Wall Street movie, has been quietly amassing a large stake in the gambling industry. His investment firm, Belfort Capital Partners, has made major investments in casino operators such as Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS).</p>
<p>The move comes as no surprise to industry insiders, who have long known of Belfort’s love of gambling. In fact, he was known on Wall Street for throwing lavish parties that often included lots of betting and blackjack.</p>
<p>“Jordan is a very savvy investor and he knows that gambling is a growth industry,” said casino analyst Tony D’Angelo. “He’s also well aware of the potential profits that can be made from owning casino stocks.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Belfort’s investment firm has already reaped big rewards from its casino bets. In just the past 12 months, its portfolio has generated gains of more than 60%.</p>
<p>Belfort says he’s not done yet and plans to continue investing in the gambling industry. “I believe there is still plenty of upside potential in the sector,” he said. “There are still a lot of states where gambling is illegal or not very developed. I see great potential for growth in those markets.”</p>
<h1 id="High-Rolling-Gambler-Nets-10-Million-In-One-Night"><a href="#High-Rolling-Gambler-Nets-10-Million-In-One-Night" class="headerlink" title="High-Rolling Gambler Nets $10 Million In One Night"></a>High-Rolling Gambler Nets $10 Million In One Night</h1><p>John, a professional gambler, hit the jackpot earlier this week when he won $10 million from a single casino night. John had been planning his big score for months, and everything went according to plan.</p>
<p>He started by making small bets at the blackjack table. As his profits grew, he began to increase his bets. By the time he reached the high-roller table, John was betting thousands of dollars on each hand.</p>
<p>The other players at the table were no match for John’s skills. With each winning hand, his stack of chips grew larger and larger. In the end, John walked away with more than $10 million in winnings.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether John will continue to gamble or if he’ll retire on his new fortune. Either way, he’s sure to make waves in the casino world.</p>
<h1 id="Vegas-Casino-Owner-Amasses-Fortune-From-Gambling"><a href="#Vegas-Casino-Owner-Amasses-Fortune-From-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Casino Owner Amasses Fortune From Gambling"></a>Vegas Casino Owner Amasses Fortune From Gambling</h1><p>Casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is one of the richest people in the world, and he owes it all to gambling. The 82-year-old made his fortune in the casino industry, and he has since become one of the most influential people in politics.</p>
<p>Adelson got his start in the business by investing in a bingo hall in Boston in the 1970s. He soon expanded his business to Las Vegas, where he opened the Sands Casino. The casino was a huge success, and Adelson soon became one of the richest men in America.</p>
<p>Adelson has continued to be successful in the casino industry, and he is now worth an estimated $35 billion. Much of his wealth has come from his casinos in Macau, which are some of the most profitable casinos in the world.</p>
<p>Adelson has also been successful in politics, and he is now one of the biggest donors to Republican candidates. He was a major donor to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and he has also been a big supporter of Israeli politics.</p>
<p>Adelson is a controversial figure, but there’s no doubt that he is one of the most successful businessmen in America. He has built an empire based on gambling, and there’s no telling how much farther he will go.</p>
<h1 id="Chinese-Businessman-Bets-Big-On-Gambling-and-Wins"><a href="#Chinese-Businessman-Bets-Big-On-Gambling-and-Wins" class="headerlink" title="Chinese Businessman Bets Big On Gambling and Wins"></a>Chinese Businessman Bets Big On Gambling and Wins</h1><p>It was a gamble that paid off handsomely for Chinese tycoon Wang Sicong.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old made a fortune in 2016 by investing in the online gaming industry, which is now worth an estimated $22 billion.</p>
<p>China has more than 650 million active gamers, making it the world’s largest market for video games.</p>
<p>Wang’s biggest bet was on DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports), which is growing rapidly in China. The market is expected to be worth $14.5 billion by 2020, up from $2.6 billion last year.</p>
<p>Wang first got into the business in 2016 by acquiring a majority stake in Game of War, a leading DFS company in China. He later acquired stakes in several other leading DFS companies, including CSGOLounge and DraftKings.</p>
<p>DFS is extremely popular in China, where there are millions of players who love to bet on sports, games and other activities. In fact, 80% of all DFS bets placed globally are placed in China.</p>
<p>Wang’s investments have paid off handsomely, with DFS revenues in China growing at an annual rate of 200%.</p>
<p>Wang has also been successful in the casino business. In 2017, he acquired a controlling stake in troubled Macau casino operator SJM Holdings for $4 billion. The move was seen as a bet on the resurgence of the gambling industry in Macau.</p>
<p>Macau is the only place in China where gambling is legal and it accounts for more than half of all global gaming revenue. However, casino revenues have been falling due to increased regulation and competition from new casinos in neighbouring countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam.</p>
<h1 id="Irish-Bookie-Becomes-Millionaire-From-Gambling"><a href="#Irish-Bookie-Becomes-Millionaire-From-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Irish Bookie Becomes Millionaire From Gambling"></a>Irish Bookie Becomes Millionaire From Gambling</h1><p>An Irish bookie has become a millionaire from gambling after making a series of shrewd bets, including one on a long-shot at the Cheltenham Festival.</p>
<p>The bookmaker, who only wishes to be identified as Paddy, started out with just €100 but quickly turned it into €1 million by making a range of bets on horse and greyhound racing.</p>
<p>Despite his good fortune, Paddy says he won’t be quitting his day job just yet. “I’ll keep my day job for sure - this is just a bit of fun on the side,” he said.</p>
<p>Paddy’s biggest win came at Cheltenham last week when he placed a bet on 33/1 shot Present Man to win the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle. The horse duly obliged, netting Paddy a cool €180,000 payoff.</p>
<p>“There were plenty of people in the pub laughing when I told them I had put money on that horse,” said Paddy. “But I was confident it would win.”</p>
<p>Gambling can be a risky business, but as Paddy has shown, it can also be lucrative. So if you’re feeling lucky, why not have a go at roulette or blackjack? Who knows - you might just become a millionaire yourself!</p>

The casino, which had been in operation since 1978, was one of the oldest casinos in the city.</p>
<p>The demolition of the Fremont Street Casino was carried out by Controlled Demolition Inc., a company that specializes in the demolition of large structures. The company used a series of explosives to take down the casino.</p>
<p>Some observers said that the demolition was not very impressive. “It just looked like a lot of dust and debris going up into the air,” said one witness. Others said that they were sad to see the casino go.</p>
<p>The Fremont Street Casino was not very popular with tourists in recent years. It was overshadowed by newer and more flashy casinos in Las Vegas such as the Bellagio and Wynn Las Vegas.</p>
<h1 id="Fremont-Street-Casino-to-be-Demolished"><a href="#Fremont-Street-Casino-to-be-Demolished" class="headerlink" title="Fremont Street Casino to be Demolished"></a>Fremont Street Casino to be Demolished</h1><p>The Fremont Street Casino is to be demolished in order to make room for a new luxury hotel.</p>
<p>The casino, which has been a fixture on the Las Vegas Strip for over 30 years, will be replaced by the new SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. The $415 million project is set to open in late 2014.</p>
<p>“The demolition of Fremont Street Casino is bittersweet,” said project spokesperson Sergio Sanders. “We are excited to bring a new hotel and casino to the Las Vegas Strip, but we are sad to see such an iconic property go.”</p>
<p>The new SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino will be a high-end property with over 1,600 rooms and suites. It will also feature a casino, spa, nightclubs, restaurants and retail outlets.</p>
<p>“This is an important project for us,” said company CEO Robert Fishman. “We believe that the SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino will be one of the most exciting and talked-about properties on the Las Vegas Strip.”</p>
<h1 id="Global-Poker-Login-Plans-to-Demolish-Fremont-Street-Casino"><a href="#Global-Poker-Login-Plans-to-Demolish-Fremont-Street-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Global Poker Login Plans to Demolish Fremont Street Casino"></a>Global Poker Login Plans to Demolish Fremont Street Casino</h1><p>Residents of the city of Las Vegas and visitors to the area have mixed reactions to the news that Global Poker Login (GPL) has plans to demolish the Fremont Street casino. The iconic neon-lit casino, which has been a fixture in the city for over 50 years, will be replaced with a new GPL resort.</p>
<p>The company’s CEO, DamonPSmith, issued a statement saying that the new resort will be “the most innovative and exciting poker destination on the planet.” He went on to say that the resort would feature “world-class amenities and attractions” and that it would be the perfect place for anyone who loves poker.</p>
<p>Some people are excited about the prospect of a new poker-themed resort opening in Las Vegas. They believe that it will draw more tourists to the city and generate additional revenue for local businesses. Others view GPL’s plans as a threat to Las Vegas’s existing casinos and worry that it will cannibalize their customer base.</p>
<p>Fremont Street casino employees are among those who are most worried about their jobs. They fear that the new GPL resort will put them out of work and that they will not be able to find other employment in Las Vegas. GPL has promised that all employees of the Fremont Street casino will be offered jobs at its new resort, but many of them are skeptical.</p>
<p>There is also concern about how this development will impact traffic in downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street casino is located in a busy area, and adding another major hotel/resort to the mix is likely to cause even more traffic problems. Some people have suggested that GPL consider building its new resort elsewhere in the city, but so far there has been no indication that they are considering such a move.</p>
<h1 id="Fremont-Street-Casino-Being-Torn-Down-for-Parking-Lot"><a href="#Fremont-Street-Casino-Being-Torn-Down-for-Parking-Lot" class="headerlink" title="Fremont Street Casino Being Torn Down for Parking Lot?"></a>Fremont Street Casino Being Torn Down for Parking Lot?</h1><p>There is a lot of speculation going around about the Fremont Street Casino being torn down for a parking lot. The casino has been in business for over 30 years and is one of the most popular in the area. It’s not clear why the developers would want to tear it down, but there are already plans in place to do so.</p>
<p>Some people are saying that this is simply a ploy to get more people to visit the casino, but others aren’t so sure. There has been no official statement released by the casino or the developers, so it’s hard to know what’s really going on. In the meantime, though, people are getting ready to say goodbye to their favorite casino.</p>

Are you wondering if there are any tips or tricks to help improve your chances of winning? Wonder no more! Slot machines are definitely one of the easiest games to play in a casino, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t things you can do to up your odds.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind when playing slots is that they are essentially a “luck-based” game. This means that your chances of winning are based purely on luck and not on any sort of skill. However, this doesn’t mean that there isn’t anything you can do to improve your chances! Here are a few tips to help get you started:</p>
<p>#1 – Choose Machines with Higher Payouts</p>
<p>One way to increase your chances of winning is to choose machines with higher payouts. This means that the jackpot for these machines is typically higher, and therefore the odds of winning are also higher. However, it is important to note that these machines tend to be busier than others, so you may have to wait longer for a seat.</p>
<p>#2 – Stick to Your Bankroll</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when playing slots is to stick to your bankroll. This means only betting amounts that you are comfortable losing. If you go overboard and bet more than you can afford, you run the risk of going into debt or even worse, losing all your money. So remember, it’s always best to play it safe and bet within your limits!</p>
<p>#3 – Play the Maximum Number of Lines</p>
<p>Many slot machines allow players to bet on multiple lines at once. This means that you can increase your chances of winning by playing the maximum number of lines. Not only does this give you more chances to win, but it also increases your payout amount if you do happen to hit the jackpot. So be sure set those lines at maximum and watch those wins add up!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Slot-Machines-Every-Time"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Slot-Machines-Every-Time" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Slot Machines Every Time"></a>How to Win at Slot Machines Every Time</h1><p>Gambling is a fun and exciting way to pass the time, but it can be frustrating if you constantly lose money. If you want to start winning at the slot machines, follow these tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose a machine that’s been recently hit. The longer it’s been since the last payout, the more likely it is that the next one will come soon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for machines with high payouts. The higher the payout percentage, the more money you’ll stand to win.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bet on multiple lines. This increases your chances of winning by covering more possible combinations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stick to denominations you’re comfortable with. If you’re not comfortable betting large amounts of money, stick to smaller denominations. You’ll still have a chance of winning, but you won’t risk as much money if you lose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid progressive jackpot slots. These machines have sky-high payouts, but your chances of winning are very slim. Play regular slots instead and you’ll have a better chance of coming out ahead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow these tips, you’re sure to start winning at slot machines more often!</p>
<h1 id="Secret-Tips-to-Winning-at-Slot-Machines"><a href="#Secret-Tips-to-Winning-at-Slot-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Secret Tips to Winning at Slot Machines"></a>Secret Tips to Winning at Slot Machines</h1><p>Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games, enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. Though slot machines may seem like a luck-based game, there are actually a few secrets that can help you to win more often.</p>
<p>Below are some tips for playing slots that will give you the best chance of winning:</p>
<p>Tip 1: Know the odds</p>
<p>The first step to winning at slots is understanding the odds. Slot machines typically have a house edge of around 3%, so in order to make money in the long run, you need to be wagering more than this amount.</p>
<p>However, there are some exceptions – particularly progressive jackpot slots, which have a much higher house edge. So if you’re looking to maximise your chances of winning, it’s best to stick to regular slots rather than progressive ones.</p>
<p>Tip 2: Play maximum bet amounts</p>
<p>Another way to maximise your chances of winning at slots is to play maximum bet amounts. This means betting the maximum amount allowed on each spin, as this increases your chances of winning a payout.</p>
<p>While playing maximum bet amounts can be expensive, it can also be lucrative if you hit a big win. So if you have the bankroll to afford it, playing max bets is definitely the way to go.</p>

The casino is currently the third-oldest operating in the state, having first opened its doors in 1999.</p>
<p>In that time, it has been passed by both FireKeepers Casino Hotel (opened in 2009) and Soaring Eagle Casino &amp; Resort (opened in 1998). Even more concerning for Turning Rock is the fact that there are six other tribal casinos currently operating in Michigan, five of which are newer than Turning Rock.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for Turning Rock, as they still see over 2 million visitors per year and boast a gaming floor of over 125,000 square feet. But with increasing competition and an aging property, Turning Rock may need to consider making some updates to stay competitive.</p>
<p>One possible avenue could be updating their gaming floor to appeal to a more modern audience. This could involve adding new and popular games like slots or electronic table games. Additionally, they could look to beef up their non-gaming amenities in an attempt to attract those who aren’t interested in gambling.</p>
<p>This could include renovating their hotel or restaurant offerings, or even adding a new entertainment venue. Whatever route they choose, it will be important for Turning Rock to act quickly if they want to stay relevant in Michigan’s competitive casino market.</p>
<h1 id="Q-Casino-Continues-to-be-the-Place-to-Gamble-in-Iowa"><a href="#Q-Casino-Continues-to-be-the-Place-to-Gamble-in-Iowa" class="headerlink" title="Q Casino Continues to be the Place to Gamble in Iowa"></a>Q Casino Continues to be the Place to Gamble in Iowa</h1><p>Casinos are a popular pastime all around the United States, but in Iowa, there’s one casino that reigns supreme: Q Casino.</p>
<p>Q Casino has been a fixture of the Iowa gambling scene since it opened in 2006, and it has only gotten better with age. The casino features over 1,700 slot machines and 50 table games, as well as a variety of dining options.</p>
<p>Q Casino is also home to the Table Games Shootout, an annual tournament that pits the best poker players in the state against each other. There’s over $100,000 in prize money up for grabs at the shootout, so there’s plenty of incentive to play your best.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a place to gamble in Iowa, Q Casino is definitely the place to go. With its massive selection of games and great atmosphere, Q Casino is sure to provide you with hours of entertainment.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Turning-Rock-Casino-Still-Relevant"><a href="#Is-Turning-Rock-Casino-Still-Relevant" class="headerlink" title="Is Turning Rock Casino Still Relevant?"></a>Is Turning Rock Casino Still Relevant?</h1><p>The Turning Stone Casino Resort is a world-renowned resort and casino complex in the heart of New York’s “Finger Lakes” region, and is one of the largest and most successful tourist destinations in the State. The 4,200 acre resort features 302 hotel rooms, a 97,000 square foot casino gaming floor, three golf courses (including one designed by Arnold Palmer), five restaurants, extensive banquet facilities, a full-service spa and salon, an 18-hole Miniature Golf course and more.</p>
<p>The Turning Stone Casino Resort was built on the site of a former limestone quarry in 1992 by brothers Gilbert and Anthony J. Bino. The casino was originally owned and operated by the Oneida Indian Nation. In early 2013, the Oneida Nation announced it would be seeking to divest its interest in the casino resort. The tribe announced it had retained Deutsche Bank to seek potential buyers for its stake in the property.</p>
<p>In May of 2013, it was announced that the ownership of the Turning Stone Casino Resort had been transferred from the Oneida Indian Nation to a new company formed specifically for this purchase; Two Plus Two Hospitality Group LLC. This new company is made up of two experienced casino executives: Jim Ryan (former President of Caesars Entertainment) and Tom Gallagher (former CEO of MGM MIRAGE). In announcing this new ownership group, Ryan stated his intention to make the Turning Stone Casino Resort “the East Coast’s premier destination resort”.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that Ryan and Gallagher are making good on their promise. Since taking over ownership of the property, they have made significant investments in upgrading both the physical plant and the gaming offering at the casino resort. They have also instituted a number of marketing programs aimed at attracting more visitors to the property.</p>
<p>One such program is “Turning Stone Rewards”, which is their player loyalty program. It is one of the most rewarding loyalty programs in New York state, with points that can be redeemed for free play, food comps, room nights and more. They have also introduced a new player rewards card called “The Club”. This card gives players access to exclusive benefits like complimentary valet parking, express check-in/check-out and complimentary room upgrades (subject to availability). The Club membership is free for all guests who sign up when they visit the casino resort.</p>
<p>In addition to these marketing initiatives, Ryan and Gallagher have made substantial investments in both the physical plant and gaming product at Turning Stone Casino Resort. Some of these investments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$6 million renovation of Players Club cardroom including installation of new poker tables, chairs and carpeting * $1 million renovation of High Limit area including installation of new blackjack tables * $500 thousand upgrade to internet bandwidth capacity to support high-speed gaming * $250 thousand upgrade to audio/visual systems throughout casino floor * Addition of popular slot machines like Game King Slots Triple Double Diamonds * New player kiosks throughout casino floor</li>
</ul>
<p>  So far it would appear that Turning Rock Casino Resort is still very relevant despite some changes in ownership back in 2013. With an expansive list if offerings from luxurious accomodations ,to award winning golf courses ,three lavish restaurants ,a first class spa ,and an exciting 97000 sqft casino filled with all your favorite games , there’s something for everyone here .
