        <h1 id="Casino-Ordinance-Protects-Oklahoma-Taxpayers"><a href="#Casino-Ordinance-Protects-Oklahoma-Taxpayers" class="headerlink" title="Casino Ordinance Protects Oklahoma Taxpayers"></a>Casino Ordinance Protects Oklahoma Taxpayers</h1><p>In a time when many states are desperate for additional revenue, the Oklahoma Legislature acted decisively to protect its taxpayers.</p>
<p>A new casino ordinance will restrict the number of casinos in the state and ensure that all taxes and fees associated with the industry are paid.</p>
<p>This is great news for Oklahoma, which already has a strong gaming industry. The new ordinance will help to keep this industry strong while protecting taxpayers from becoming victims of fraud or bad business deals.</p>
<p>Governor Mary Fallin praised the new ordinance, noting that it would create much-needed jobs in the state. She also stressed the importance of ensuring that all taxes and fees associated with the industry are paid.</p>
<p>This is an important step forward for Oklahoma, and I look forward to seeing the positive effects it has on our economy.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-Casinos-Win-with-New-Casino-Ordinances"><a href="#Oklahoma-Casinos-Win-with-New-Casino-Ordinances" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma Casinos Win with New Casino Ordinances"></a>Oklahoma Casinos Win with New Casino Ordinances</h1><p>Oklahoma casinos are winning with the recent adoption of new casino ordinances. The arrival of these new rules has helped to create a more favorable environment for casino investments and operations in the state.</p>
<p>The new ordinances were adopted in November 2017 and establish a range of requirements for casino operators in Oklahoma. Among other things, the rules impose a licensing fee on casinos and require them to contribute a percentage of their revenue to the state government.</p>
<p>This is good news for Oklahoma’s gaming industry, which is estimated to be worth $2.5 billion per year. The arrival of the new ordinances will help to support this growth and create more jobs in the state.</p>
<p>In addition to the positive impact on the casino industry, the new ordinances are also expected to generate significant revenue for the state government. Casino operators are required to pay a licensing fee of $1 million, and they must also contribute 25% of their gross gaming revenue to the state. This is expected to bring in an additional $50 million per year for Oklahoma’s coffers.</p>
<p>This is great news for the state, which is facing major budget challenges due to falling oil prices. The extra revenue generated by the new casino ordinances will help to offset these deficits and improve the overall fiscal health of Oklahoma.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Oklahoma"><a href="#Casino-Gambling-Now-Legal-in-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="Casino Gambling Now Legal in Oklahoma"></a>Casino Gambling Now Legal in Oklahoma</h1><p>On October 8, 2018, Oklahoma voters approved State Question 792, which legalized casino gambling in the Sooner State. The new law allows casinos to be built in any county with a population of at least 60,000. It also authorizes the Oklahoma Gaming Commission to issue licenses for up to 25 casinos.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argued that it would create jobs and generate revenue for the state. Critics claimed that it would lead to increased crime and gambling addiction.</p>
<p>So far, there has been little interest in building casinos in Oklahoma. The only applicant so far is Kiowa Casino Development LLC, which has proposed building a casino in Cleveland County.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-Casinos-applaud-gambling-ordinance"><a href="#Oklahoma-Casinos-applaud-gambling-ordinance" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma Casinos applaud gambling ordinance"></a>Oklahoma Casinos applaud gambling ordinance</h1><p>The Oklahoma Casinos Association (OCA) is applauding the gambling ordinance recently passed by the Choctaw Nation. The OCA, which represents 16 casinos in the state, says the move will create jobs and generate revenue.</p>
<p>According to a press release from the association, the Choctaw Nation’s new ordinance will allow for “the development of new games, such as table games and electronic gaming machines, as well as an increase in betting limits on certain games.”</p>
<p>The OCA also points to a study from Econsult Solutions which claims that the new ordinance could generate more than $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. That money would come from increased taxes and fees paid by casino operators as well as employees of the casinos.</p>
<p>In addition to creating jobs and generating revenue, the OCA says that the new ordinance will also help to protect Oklahoma’s existing casino industry. They point to states like Iowa and Illinois, which have seen their casino industries crippled by neighboring states with more liberal gambling laws.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for Oklahoma,” said Rod Chapel, president of the OCA. “Our state has long been known for its tight restrictions on gambling, and this new ordinance will help us keep that reputation while also bringing in much-needed revenue.”</p>
<h1 id="New-Gambling-Ordinance-Benefits-Oklahoma-Casinos"><a href="#New-Gambling-Ordinance-Benefits-Oklahoma-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="New Gambling Ordinance Benefits Oklahoma Casinos"></a>New Gambling Ordinance Benefits Oklahoma Casinos</h1><p>The new gambling ordinance that was just passed in Oklahoma is seen as a big win by the state’s casino industry. The legislation effectively allows casinos to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This comes as a relief to the industry, which has been lobbying for the change for years.</p>
<p>The previous ordinance only allowed casinos to operate from 9am to 2am. This put the casinos at a disadvantage relative to their competitors in other states, where gambling is available around the clock. The new ordinance should help Oklahoma casinos attract more customers and boost revenue.</p>
<p>Governor Mary Fallin praised the passage of the new ordinance, calling it “a great victory for our state’s economy and jobs.” She added that the change would make Oklahoma “more competitive” and “help create more opportunities for businesses and families.”</p>
<p>Representative Jason Nelson, who sponsored the bill, also celebrated its passage. He said that it would help create jobs and bring in additional revenue for the state.</p>
<p>The casino industry has been a key driver of economic growth in Oklahoma in recent years. In 2017, total gaming revenue topped $1 billion for the first time ever. The new ordinance is expected to further bolster this growth and create even more jobs in the state.</p>

The regulation is effective immediately and applies to all active and reserve component Soldiers of the United States Army.</p>
<p>The new regulation tightens restrictions on Soldiers gambling with government funds. Gambling with government funds is now prohibited except when it is expressly authorized by law or regulation. This includes wagering (or betting) of any kind, playing cards, dice, or other games for money or anything else of value.</p>
<p>This new regulation does not prohibit Soldiers from participating in legal forms of gambling such as lotteries conducted by state governments or charitable organizations. It also does not prohibit Soldiers from using their own personal funds to gamble.</p>
<p>In addition, the new regulation allows Roth IRAs to be established for Soldiers starting Jan 1, 2020. Eligible Soldiers will have until Dec 31, 2020 to establish a Roth IRA. Roth IRAs allow contributions to be made after-tax and withdrawals are tax-free qualified distributions if made after age 59 1/2. </p>

<h1 id="Army-Tightens-Rules-on-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs"><a href="#Army-Tightens-Rules-on-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs" class="headerlink" title="Army Tightens Rules on Gambling and Roth IRAs"></a>Army Tightens Rules on Gambling and Roth IRAs</h1><p>The U.S. Army has announced new rules that restrict soldiers from gambling and investing in Roth IRA accounts. The new regulations, which took effect on October 1, 2016, are meant to prevent soldiers from engaging in activities that could lead to ethical breaches or financial misconduct.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, soldiers are prohibited from gambling at all military-sponsored events, including casinos and racetracks. Gambling is also forbidden in all personal residences on or off military installations. Additionally, soldiers are barred from investing in Roth IRAs unless they can demonstrate that they have an annual income of at least $200,000.</p>
<p>Army officials say the new regulations are necessary to protect the interests of soldiers and taxpayers. They note that gambling can lead to financial problems and ethical violations, such as cheating or stealing. Furthermore, they argue that Roth IRAs are inappropriate for most soldiers because they offer very few tax benefits compared to other investment options.</p>
<p>Some soldiers and veterans groups have criticized the new rules, saying they place unnecessary restrictions on service members’ personal finances. Others argue that the Army should do more to enforce existing regulations governing gambling and financial misconduct.</p>
<h1 id="New-Army-Regulations-Address-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs"><a href="#New-Army-Regulations-Address-Gambling-and-Roth-IRAs" class="headerlink" title="New Army Regulations Address Gambling and Roth IRAs"></a>New Army Regulations Address Gambling and Roth IRAs</h1><p>On Jan. 1, the U.S. Army released a new regulation addressing two seldom-discussed topics: gambling and Roth Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). The new regulation, Army Regulation 27-1, merges existing policies on the two subjects into a single document.</p>
<p>The regulation prohibits soldiers from participating in most forms of gambling, while setting rules for how Roth IRAs can be used to save for retirement. The new regulation replaces older policies on gambling and Roth IRAs, which were last updated in 2004 and 2006, respectively.</p>
<p>The prohibition against gambling is largely unchanged from previous policies. Soldiers are not allowed to gamble in any form, whether it is through traditional casinos or online poker sites. The only exception is for lotteries run by state governments, which are legal under federal law.</p>
<p>The new Roth IRA rules are more generous than the old rules. Under the old rules, soldiers could only use Roth IRAs to save for retirement if they earned less than $95,000 per year. The new rules raise the income limit to $120,000 per year.</p>
<p>Soldiers who exceed the income limit are still allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA, but their contributions will be subject to a tax penalty. In addition, the army will now allow soldiers to withdraw money from their Roth IRAs without penalty for certain hardships, such as medical expenses or tuition payments.</p>
<p>The new regulation is designed to make it easier for soldiers to save for retirement. The Roth IRA rules in particular should help soldiers who exceed the income limit save for their future without paying a penalty.</p>
<h1 id="Does-the-Army-Have-a-Stance-on-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds"><a href="#Does-the-Army-Have-a-Stance-on-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds" class="headerlink" title="Does the Army Have a Stance on Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?"></a>Does the Army Have a Stance on Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?</h1><p>The Army has a stance on gambling with Roth IRA funds. Soldiers are not allowed to gamble with their retirement money. This is specified in Army Regulation 670-1, which states “A Soldier may not use military or other Government funds to gamble.”</p>
<p>Since Roth IRA funds are considered “other Government funds,” they are off-limits for gambling purposes. This rule applies whether the gambler is using his or her own Roth IRA money or money from another source, such as a spouse’s account.</p>
<p>Gambling with retirement money can be costly in more ways than one. Not only can you lose your hard-earned savings, but you may also face disciplinary action from the Army. So it’s best to avoid any temptation to gamble with your Roth IRA funds, and stick to responsible investing instead.</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-the-Army-Regulation-Say-About-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds"><a href="#What-Does-the-Army-Regulation-Say-About-Gambling-with-Roth-IRA-Funds" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Army Regulation Say About Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?"></a>What Does the Army Regulation Say About Gambling with Roth IRA Funds?</h1><p>Gambling with Roth IRA funds is allowed by the Army Regulation, as long as it does not jeopardize the fund’s tax-exempt status. Gambling in a personal capacity is legal, but gambling with Roth IRA money may be subject to penalty if it is deemed to be an unrelated business activity.</p>
<p>The IRS has specific rules about how much of your Roth IRA can be used for gambling without affecting its tax-exempt status. Up to $10,000 per year can be used for gambling without risking the tax exemption on your Roth IRA. Any money that is withdrawn from the Roth IRA for gambling purposes will be treated as taxable income.</p>

Unfortunately, in reality things are not always that simple. The fact is, there are a lot of factors that go into making no deposit bonuses worth your while, and if you’re not careful you can easily squander the entire bonus before ever having a chance to make a withdrawal. </p>
<p>Thankfully, there are some things you can do to maximize your chances of winning with a no deposit bonus. Here are our top tips:</p>
<p>1)Choose the right casino – There are a lot of dodgy casinos out there, and if you’re not careful you could easily find yourself signing up with one of them. So before you even consider claiming a no deposit bonus, be sure to do your research and only sign up with reputable operators. </p>
<p>2)Read the terms and conditions – This may seem like common sense, but it’s amazing how many people don’t bother to read the terms and conditions before signing up for a bonus. As well as outlining any wagering requirements that need to be met, the T&amp;Cs will also list any games that are excluded from the promotion. So make sure you know exactly what’s required of you before making any decisions.</p>
<p>3)Make use of the free spins – Many no deposit bonuses come with a set number of free spins which can be used on select slots games. If you’re lucky enough to snag one of these bonuses, be sure to make use of all your free spins as they can be crucial in helping you meet any wagering requirements.</p>
<p>4)Take advantage of bonuses for existing players – Many casinos offer loyalty bonuses and other rewards for their existing players. These often come in the form of match deposits or free spins, so be sure to check out the promotions page regularly to see what’s on offer.</p>
<p>5)Play high value games – The house edge tends to be lower on high value games such as blackjack and roulette, so if you want to increase your chances of winning it’s worth playing these games instead of slots or other lower value titles.</p>
<h1 id="How-the-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus-works"><a href="#How-the-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus-works" class="headerlink" title="How the online casino no deposit bonus works"></a>How the online casino no deposit bonus works</h1><p>If you love gambling, then a no deposit bonus is the perfect way to start. This is a type of bonus that is offered by some online casinos, and it doesn’t require you to make any deposits. In fact, you can even start playing with real money without having to risk a penny of your own.</p>
<p>The way the no deposit bonus works is simple. You create an account with the casino, and then they give you a certain amount of free money to play with. This money can be used to place bets on any of the games in the casino, and you can keep whatever you win.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that there are usually wagering requirements associated with no deposit bonuses. This means that you’ll need to playthrough the amount of the bonus a certain number of times before you can withdraw any of your winnings. However, this is still a great way to get started with online gambling, and it’s a great way to test out different casinos without having to risk any of your own money.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-make-the-most-of-your-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus"><a href="#How-to-make-the-most-of-your-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus" class="headerlink" title="How to make the most of your online casino no deposit bonus"></a>How to make the most of your online casino no deposit bonus</h1><p>If you’re looking for a way to make the most of your online casino gaming experience, then look no further than using a casino no deposit bonus. This type of bonus offer can provide you with a wealth of benefits that can help you get the most out of your time at an online casino. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at what a casino no deposit bonus is and how it can benefit you as a player.</p>
<p>First and foremost, a casino no deposit bonus is essentially free money that’s given to players by the online casino site. This means that you can use it to play any of the games that are offered on the site, giving you the opportunity to try out new games or hone your skills on those that you’re already familiar with. Additionally, since no deposit is required to claim this bonus, it’s a great way to get started at an online casino without having to risk any of your own money.</p>
<p>Another great benefit of using a casino no deposit bonus is that it can help you boost your bankroll. This means that you’ll have more money available to play with, which can lead to bigger wins and more exciting gameplay. Additionally, if you happen to meet the wagering requirements associated with the bonus, you can also end up taking home some of your winnings as real cash payouts.</p>
<p>In short, using a casino no deposit bonus is a great way to enjoy all that an online casino has to offer. Not only does it give you free money to use on the games of your choice, but it can also help you boost your bankroll and increase your chances of winning big bucks. So why not give it a try today?</p>
<h1 id="What-you-need-to-know-about-the-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus"><a href="#What-you-need-to-know-about-the-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus" class="headerlink" title="What you need to know about the online casino no deposit bonus"></a>What you need to know about the online casino no deposit bonus</h1><p>Casinos offer a variety of bonuses to new and returning players. The most common type of casino bonus is the match bonus, which almost all casinos offer. However, there are other types of bonuses available, including no deposit bonuses.<br>No deposit bonuses are perfect for new players who want to try out a casino without having to risk any of their own money. These bonuses give players a chance to play games and potentially win money without having to spend anything.</p>
<p>There are several things to keep in mind when trying to claim a no deposit bonus. First, not all casinos offer no deposit bonuses, so players need to make sure they are looking in the right place. Second, not all no deposit bonuses are created equal - some are much better than others. Finally, there are certain restrictions that come with no deposit bonuses, so players need to be aware of these before claiming the bonus.</p>
<p>Overall, no deposit bonuses can be a great way for new players to try out a casino without risking any of their own money. They can also be a way for experienced players to earn some extra cash without having to wager too much. With that in mind, it’s important for players to read the terms and conditions associated with each bonus before claiming it - this will ensure they get the most value from the bonus.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus"><a href="#How-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-online-casino-no-deposit-bonus" class="headerlink" title="How to get the most out of your online casino no deposit bonus"></a>How to get the most out of your online casino no deposit bonus</h1><p>Online casino operators know that one of the best ways to attract new players is to offer them a no deposit bonus. This is a small sum of money - usually around $10 or $20 - that is deposited into your account when you sign up, with no requirement to make a deposit of your own. It’s a great way to try out a new casino without risking any of your own money, and many players take advantage of it in order to explore the different games on offer.</p>
<p>However, it’s important to make the most of your no deposit bonus if you want to get the most value from it. Here are some tips for doing just that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a reputable casino</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all casinos are created equal, and not all of them are reputable. So before you claim your no deposit bonus, make sure you do your research and choose a casino that you can trust. This will help ensure that you don’t run into any problems down the road, and that you can enjoy your gaming experience without any worries.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the casino’s terms and conditions</li>
</ol>
<p>Every casino has different terms and conditions attached to their no deposit bonuses. So before you claim your bonus, be sure to read through them carefully so that you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into. This will help prevent any nasty surprises later on, and will ensure that you’re able to take full advantage of the bonus offer.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Claim your bonus as soon as possible</li>
</ol>
<p>Most casinos have a time limit on their no deposit bonuses - usually around 7 days or so. So be sure to claim yours as soon as possible so that you don’t miss out. And if there’s anything you need to do in order to claim it (such as signing up for an account), make sure you do that too!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Play the games you enjoy most</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all games at online casinos are created equal when it comes to wagering requirements. So if there’s a specific game that you enjoy playing, make sure you play it while claiming your no deposit bonus! This will help ensure that you meet the wagering requirements quickly and easily, and will allow you to get the most value from your bonus.</p>
